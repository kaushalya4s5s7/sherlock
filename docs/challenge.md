TigerGraph Agentic Fraud Investigation HHGOA
Build an AI Agent for Fraud Investigation and Next-Best Action
Fraud teams at financial institutions are under constant pressure. Analysts must manually gather transaction history, trace money movement, identify connected accounts, review policies, assess risk, document findings, and decide what action to take. This process is slow, fragmented, difficult to scale, and often completes only after the money is already gone.
This hackathon challenges participants to build an Agentic Fraud Investigation Agent powered by TigerGraph that investigates fraud and recommends the next best actions when the available signals are uncertain.
Core Challenge / Design Guidelines
Build an AI agent that investigates fraud, creates and progresses cases, and recommends the next best action when available signals are uncertain.
The challenge is to accurately identify fraud patterns, determine what action to take, identify what additional evidence is needed, and decide when there is enough information to act.

The agent:
Investigate fraud when triggered by:
A fraud signal or risk score
A customer report
A fraud analyst
Gather and analyze evidence from:
Knowledge graphs
Transaction history
Device and identity signals
Account behavior
Prior fraud cases
External data sources
Assess the situation by
Identifying fraud patterns
Determine the likely type of fraud 
Assessing the level of risk based on available evidence.
Create and progress a fraud case:
Create a case when investigation is warranted
Add new evidence and findings as the investigation progresses
Update the case status, risk assessment, and recommended actions
Maintain a record of decisions and actions taken
Use case memory to improve investigations:
Store relevant findings, decisions, actions, and outcomes from prior cases
Retrieve similar past cases when investigating new activity
Use prior case outcomes and analyst decisions to inform recommendations
Identify recurring fraud patterns, entities, and relationships across cases
Update memory as new cases are resolved
Gather additional evidence when needed through controlled, policy-approved actions, such as:
Asking an account owner to validate a transaction
Requesting step-up authentication
Requesting additional information from an analyst or approved party
Recommend or take one or more next actions based on the evidence, such as:
Allow or block a transaction
Block or monitor an account
Warn a customer
Create a fraud case
File a report
Request more evidence
Escalate to a fraud analyst
Operate within predefined policies and permissions:
The agent may recommend an action
Only authorized actions may be executed
Some actions may require human approval
Determine when to stop the investigation once enough evidence is available to take a defensible action.
Explain its reasoning, including:
What evidence was used
Why additional evidence was requested
Why the selected actions were recommended
The core investigation flow is:
Trigger - start an investigation based on fraud signal, customer report, analyst request or another event
Investigate - create or open a case and examine the relevant entities, transactions, relationships, behavior and prior cases
Gather evidence - collect the evidence needed to understand the activity and update the case as new information is found
Assess uncertainty - determine the level of risk, confidence in the assessment and whether enough evidence exists to act
Gather more evidence if needed - request or obtain additional information when uncertainty remains
Take one or more next actions - recommend or execute appropriate actions and progress the case
Explain the decision - clearly describe the evidence considered, remaining uncertainty and why the actions were selected
Update case memory - record the investigation, actions, decisions and outcomes so they can inform future cases
Actions such as sending customer messages, freezing accounts, blocking cards, refunding customers, updating CRM systems, or closing cases may be simulated, stubbed, or represented through mock APIs.
What Participants Build With
Required components
TigerGraph Savanna or Community Edition.
Use either for graph and vector storage and retrieval
Both are free to use for the hackathon
Savanna: https://savanna.tgcloud.io 
Community Edition: https://dl.tigergraph.com
If you use Savanna, ensure auto-stop and auto-start are enabled
GSQL and graph algorithms
Use GSQL and TigerGraph graph algorithms for graph traversal, pattern detection, relationship analysis, and fraud investigation.
TigerGraph MCP
Use TigerGraph MCP to expose graph capabilities and data to the agent
https://github.com/tigergraph/tigergraph-mcp
GraphRAG 
Use GraphRAG to ground the agent with relevant evidence and context
This may include connected evidence retrieved from the knowledge graph and information from documents such as fraud policies, procedures and typologies
Pass the relevant context to the LLM rather than simply passing raw data
User interface
Provide a user interface to demonstrate the investigation, case progression, evidence, uncertainty, recommendations, and next actions
This can be an analyst dashboard, conversational interface, case management view or another interface of your choice
Optional components
Agent framework
Participants may use the framework of their choice, such as LangChain, LangGraph, OpenAI Agents SDK, CrewAI, or another agent framework.
A custom agent implementation is also allowed.
LLM
Participants may use the LLM or combination of models of their choice.
The LLM should be used for reasoning, tool selection, evidence synthesis, and generating explanations rather than replacing graph analysis.
Additional tools and data sources
Participants may integrate external APIs, databases, fraud signals, identity systems, or simulated customer interactions.
External sources should complement the TigerGraph-based investigation.


Dataset
Here is the dataset: HHGOA_IEEE
The dataset is built on the IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection data from Vesta Corporation, with every original row and column kept: about 590,000 card transactions over six months from about 13,500 customers, plus device and connection records for online transactions.
Every transaction includes a risk score from the bank's fraud detection model. There is no "Is Fraud" flag.
Closed investigations from the first four months are included, with cases that were confirmed as fraud and cases that were cleared.
The dataset also includes the bank's fraud policy, five known fraud patterns, and relevant regulatory references.
Twenty cases from the final two months are used as the benchmark. Every team will be evaluated on the same cases.
You may extend the dataset with additional data or sources.
Not every fraud pattern present in the data is documented.
Read the README inside the dataset first. It explains every file, every column, the answer format, and how the cases work.
Submissions

What Success Looks Like
A successful solution should demonstrate that the agent can:
Investigate a fraud case from an initial trigger.
Gather relevant evidence from the graph and other available sources.
Identify fraud patterns and assess risk.
Create and progress a fraud case as new evidence and decisions are added
Recognize when the available evidence is not sufficient or uncertain
Gather additional evidence through controlled actions when needed.
Recommend one or more appropriate next actions and update those recommendations as new evidence becomes available
Explain the evidence, reasoning, uncertainty and decisions behind its recommendations.
Operate within defined policies, permissions and approval requirements
Use prior cases and outcomes as memory to inform new investigations
Present the investigation, case progression and recommended actions  clearly through a usable interface.
The strongest solutions will show that the agent can move from uncertain fraud signals to a clear, defensible course of action, while maintaining a complete case record and using past investigations to improve future decisions
